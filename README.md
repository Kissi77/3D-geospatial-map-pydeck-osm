# Creating a 3D Geospatial Map Using PyDeck and OpenStreetMap

This project demonstrates how to create an **interactive 3D city visualization** using:
- **PyDeck**
- **OSMnx (OpenStreetMap data)**
- **Python**

The code downloads building footprints and height data for **Bonn, Germany**, processes it, and renders a 3D web-based map.

---

# Features
- Download OpenStreetMap building data via OSMnx  
- Filter and clean height attributes  
- Visualize buildings as 3D extrusions with PyDeck  
- Export an interactive `.html` map
